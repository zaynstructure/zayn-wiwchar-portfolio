            I am an artist and designer based on the unceded Coast Salish Territory of the Lekwungen and W̱SÁNEĆ nations (Victoria, BC).
            My work spans animation, sound, game design, digital media, and painting. I often explore themes of identity, grief, and alternative ways of structuring society.
            I’m drawn to process-driven approaches, layering forms and textures to create a sense of balance within fragmented or unsettled spaces.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dr. Retail</strong> – A dystopian animated satire blending claymation-inspired and paper-cut aesthetics to critique consumerism, systemic exploitation, and the absurdity of hypercapitalism.</li>
            <li><strong>Bird-Themed Card Game</strong> – A strategy game inspired by real-world bird behaviors and ecosystems, designed to reflect interdependence, resource-sharing, and the tensions between competition and collaboration.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Dimensional Sound Exhibit</strong> – An interactive sound installation that plays with convolution, spatialization, and feedback delay networks to explore perception, grief, and non-linear memory.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Beyond these projects, I’ve contributed album artwork for musicians and exhibited in spaces such as the <strong>Esquimalt Community Arts Hub</strong> and the <strong>City of Victoria’s Art in Kiosk program</strong>.
            My experimental music projects include collaborations like <strong>Palm Reader, Lo Sun, and Vague</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the core of my practice is a belief in art as a tool for resistance, healing, and reimagining possibilities. My work is shaped by principles of collaboration, experimentation, and I incorporate a decolonial and decentralizing perspective gained from my professional and educational experience in social work.
