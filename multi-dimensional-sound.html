        <p>
            <strong>Multidimensional Sound</strong> is an experimental sound exhibit that explores the concept of higher-dimensional auditory perception. 
            Drawing inspiration from the way three-dimensional objects cast shadows in lower dimensions, this project reimagines how sound might leave traces or ‘shadows’ in a multidimensional space.

        <p>
            Using spatialized audio techniques such as convolution, feedback delay networks, phase speaker arrays, and granular synthesis, the exhibit creates an immersive, surreal listening environment. 
            Physical objects in the space subtly alter the sonic experience, reinforcing the theme of dimensional ‘shadows’ and auditory presence. 
            The sound field is designed to feel surreal rather than natural, inviting audiences to engage with sound in an abstract and introspective way.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond its technical exploration, <strong>Multidimensional Sound</strong> also incorporates a deeply personal element, reflecting on grief and the idea of communication across unseen dimensions. 
            Future iterations of the project may involve AI modeling to process and reinterpret the voice of a lost friend, weaving together themes of memory, absence, and presence.
        </p>

        <p>
            Designed as a seated, shared auditory experience, <strong>Multidimensional Sound</strong> adapts to different venues and acoustic environments, making each presentation unique. 
            The project continues to evolve as a fusion of artistic expression, spatialized audio research, and personal storytelling.
