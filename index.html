 <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am Zayn Wiwchar, an artist and designer based on the unceded Coast Salish Territory of the Lekwungen and W̱SÁNEĆ nations (Victoria, BC).
            My work spans animation, sound, game design, digital media, and painting. I like to explore themes of identity, grief and anxiety, and alternative ways of structuring society.
            I’m drawn to process-driven approaches, layering forms and textures to create a sense of balance within fragmented or unsettled spaces.
        </p>

        <h3>Current Projects:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dr. Retail</strong> – A dystopian animated satire blending claymation-inspired and paper-cut aesthetics to critique consumerism, systemic exploitation, and the absurdity of hypercapitalism.</li>
            <li><strong>Bird-Themed Card Game</strong> – A strategy game inspired by real-world bird behaviors and ecosystems, designed to reflect interdependence, resource-sharing, and the tensions between competition and collaboration.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Dimensional Sound Exhibit</strong> – An interactive sound installation that plays with convolution, spatialization, and feedback delay networks to explore perception, grief, and non-linear memory.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Beyond these projects, I’ve contributed album artwork for musicians and exhibited in spaces such as the Esquimalt Community Arts Hub and the City of Victoria’s Art in Kiosk program.
            My experimental music projects include collaborations like <strong>Palm Reader, Lo::Sun, and Vague</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the core of my practice is a belief in art as a tool for resistance, healing, and reimagining possibilities. My work is shaped by principles of collaboration, experimentation, and I strive to incorporate a decolonial and decentralizing perspective gained from my professional and educational experience in social work.
